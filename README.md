# Mission-to-Mars

## Challenge Overview:
*The challenge is to gather data about the Mission to Mars Project from all over the web and display it on a central location.  In addition, this should all be done without spending any free time gathering the data manually.  To do this, I will create a script that uses BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape data, store the data in a MongoDB, and then display it all by building a web app. Oh yeah, all of this should be done with a click of a button!*
